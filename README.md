# Review Anything

An example of a web app in Flask where you can review anything.

## Getting Started

This app was built using Python 3.6 so I would suggest that as the version.

* Make sure you have the right version of Python installed on your machine.
* Clone this repo.
* Create a virtualenv and activate it.
* Change directory `cd /path/to/repo`
* Install required libraries `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Create the database `python create_db.py`
* Run `python review_anything_app.py`
